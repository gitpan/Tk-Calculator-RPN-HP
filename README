This package implements various Hewlett-Packard RPN calculators.  This
is the first beta release, designed to prototype the OO base class.

Two HP RPN calculators are supplied:

HP-21  Scientific (second generation HP-35), 1975
HP-16C Computer Scientist, 1981

These prerequsites are required to use the HP modules:

    Tk::LCD
    Tk::SlideSwitch

These prerequisites, while not strictly required by the HP modules,
are used by the sample program tkhpcalc:

    Tk::ProgressBar::Mac
    Tk::Splashscreen


Installation follows the standard idiom:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
(sudo) make install
