This package implements various Hewlett-Packard RPN calculators.  This
is the first beta release, designed to prototype the OO base class.

Two HP RPN calculators are supplied:

HP-21     Scientific (second generation HP-35, 1975
HP-16C    Computer Scientist, 1981

These prerequisites, while not strictly required by the HP modules,
are used by the sample program tkhpcalc:

Tk::Splashscreen
Tk::ProgressBar::Mac

Installation follows the standard idiom:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
(sudo) make install
